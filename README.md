# Fitblock

**_Sometimes you don't take care of yourself because you get lost in a screen.  What if you couldn't piddle on the internet until you'd earned it by completing your Fitbit steps goal?  That's just what this Chrome Extension does. If you haven't finished your steps, you aren't able to access Facebook.  It may just be that extra edge to get you off the sofa and out of the house._**
